# 🛡️ German Credit Risk Analysis

A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning and visualization project designed to evaluate and predict the creditworthiness of applicants based on various socio-economic factors. Built using **Python (Google Colab)** for analysis and **Power BI** for visual storytelling.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze the German credit dataset, build a predictive classification model for credit risk, and uncover key risk factors through visual dashboards and insights. This project aids financial institutions in minimizing defaults and making data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Distribution of loan amounts, age groups, account types, job categories, and more.
- 🔍 **Preprocessing**: Label encoding, handling imbalances, and feature engineering for model readiness.
- 🧪 **Modeling**: Logistic Regression classifier trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Power BI Dashboard with KPIs, risk distribution charts, and borrower behavior trends.
- 💡 **Business Insights**: Actionable recommendations based on key drivers of credit risk.

## 🔬 Findings & Results

| Metric         | Result     |
|----------------|------------|
| Accuracy       | ~85%       |
| Default Rate   | 20.8%      |
| Total Loans    | 1000       |
| Avg Loan Amt   | ₹3.27K     |
| Avg Duration   | 20.9 months|

- The model effectively classifies applicants as **High Risk** or **Low Risk**.
- Most defaults are associated with **unemployed applicants**, **low account balances**, and **longer loan durations**.

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

- ✅ KPIs: Total Loans, Avg Credit Amount, Default Rate
- 📊 Risk distribution by **age**, **credit amount**, and **loan duration**
- 🧩 Filters for Risk Category, Age Range
- 🧠 Strategic **Insights & Recommendations** slide integrated

---

## 📌 Business Insights

- **Longer loans (>36 months)** show higher risk of default.
- **No savings/checking account** is a strong risk indicator.
- **Credit amount without supporting income** raises red flags.
- **Young and unemployed groups** carry the highest risk levels.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Enhance credit scoring logic by weighing **account type**, **job**, and **history**.
- Restrict long-term loans to low-risk applicants only.
- Launch financial literacy programs for at-risk demographics.
- Set real-time alerts using Power BI for high-risk application patterns.
- Offer **tiered products** based on risk levels.
